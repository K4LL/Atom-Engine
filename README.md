# Atom-Engine - Project
* ## It must have 3d support
  > ### The user can also create 2d games, he will just need to create a empty object, and put Sprite Renderer on it.
* ## I will use cuda to optmize the engine
* ## The engine will have 2 dlls and 1 exe
  > ### First dll(cudal) - i will create a cuda dll that simplify the development, it will be very simple.
  > ### Second dll(cuda part) - i will use the cudal and the cuda to make the code run faster.
  > ### The exe - I will use it for almost everything, like the interface.

# Tools
* ## Boost
  > ### There are so many reasons to use Boost, but the main reason is the ublas lib. The Ublas lib provides a matrix. There is more one reason, and it its because it provides a way to read and write some files(like compressed files, images, etc).
